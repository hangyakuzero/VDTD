# Introducing the VDTD tech stack

A blazingly fast and modern tech stack for the chad.

## Vite

it uses vite on the frontend to build and render your react app

## Deno

instead of the plain old boring node js which doesn't allow you to use typescript files, we
use Deno and do whatever we want like chads

## TURSO

A self-hosted(preferably, as they charge based on the number of reads too!) blazingly fast sqlite instance,
ever heard of Love is all you need?, well some fellow tech nerds, including yours Truly believe that a self hosted Sqlite instance is all you need(for most use cases, ofc uk it better than me)

## DRIZZLE

And finally we have our own friendly neighbourhood, self-proclaimed prisma killing ORM with us,
it is a great ORM honestly, but if you prefer to raw dog sql, you can use the drizzle kit studio to manage the database too, it's really great ig.

## so in conclusion , have fun, and stay relentless

** NOTE: THIS IS LIKE A MEME PROJECT **
